# Spinny

I managed to recreate a mobile game that was pretty popular. I forgot its name.  

## Objective

✔ "Spin" from circle to circle and go as high up possible.  
❌ Running into circles / border lightning when not "spinning" will kill you.  

## Controls

🔽 Hold the down button to spin around the target circle. Target circles change as you fly past them.  

## Trying this out on Windows PC

Open flashplayer.exe in parent directory and browse to open "SpinnyGame.swf" in this folder.
