# Volfiend
**This is an Incomplete Game**

I tried to recreate a game "Volfiend" that I played on a MS-DOS machine from long ago.  
What I ended up with was more like a prototype of the game's mechanics. Expect lots of bugs.

## Objective

Venture out and rejoin another border to eliminate enemies sitting inside the newly surrounded area!

## Controls

â†•â†”: up, down, left, right arrow keys to move along borders. You are "protected" when you stay inside.  
ðŸ”›: hold "spacebar" when pressing arrow keys to "venture out" from borders. You are "vulnurble" and if enemy touches you in this state, you will take damage.

## Trying this out on Windows

Open flashplayer.exe in parent directory and browse to open "Volfiend.swf in this folder.

## Bugs / Unfinished features

- Did not implement damage mechanics
- Did not handle enemy collision
- Enemey sometimes get stuck
