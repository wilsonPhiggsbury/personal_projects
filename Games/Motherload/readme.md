# Motherload

I managed to recreate "Motherload", a game I used to play on miniclip.

## Objective

✔ Dig for minerals in the rich earth and sell it outside.  
✔ Upgrade your digger with the money earned, and dig deeper for more precious minerals.  
❌ Don't run out of fuel when underground. Plan your ascent or you will not survive!

## Controls

◀▶ Left, right arrow keys to move horizontally. Digs when obstructed.  
🔽 Down key to dig. Pressing down key on top of surface facilities will interact with them. (shop, refuel, sell minerals etc.)  
🔼 Up key to ascend.  

## Trying this out on Windows PC

Open flashplayer.exe in parent directory and browse to open "drill.swf" in this folder.
