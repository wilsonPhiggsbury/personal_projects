# Blob Factory

I managed to recreate a game I used to play on neopets.com. I forgot its name.

## Objective

✔ Click on passing paint blobs to drop them into their corresponding buckets.  
✔ Right panel shows cost of next stickman to manufacture. Once paint is sufficient, he will get made.  
❌ Don't let the pac-man gobbler eat your stickmen! Bonk its head with a blob to deter.  
❌ Wrongly dropped blobs will increase your "trash" (pink) meter. You lose when trash is full / time is out.  

## Controls

🖱 Click on the passing blobs to try and drop them into their color's bucket.  
🖱 Click on the occassional soap to try and drop it off-screen to clean up your "trash" meter.  

## Trying this out on Windows PC

Open flashplayer.exe in parent directory and browse to open "Blob_factory.swf" in this folder.  

## Variations
- "Blob_factory.swf": standard game
- "Blob_Factory Phase5.swf": cheaper stickmen
- "Blob_Factory easier.swf": cheaper stickmen with bad background art
